# CS-305_Module_8

# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

- Artemis financial is a consulting company that develop specialized financial plans for their customers. Artemis Financial is looking to modernize their operations by means of finding any vulnerabilities in their software and getting ahead of the curve and eliminating them.

# What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

- What I did well when I found their vulnerabilities was suppressing the false-positives. It is important to code securely because you eliminate any future potential of threats and compromises. Software security gives an extra layer of safety when a customer is considering them as a potential source of financial planning.

# What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

- Learning how to do dependency checks had it's ups and downs. The first few times I had no issues getting them to work, but others I struggled getting them to work. Finding out why they weren't working and using that knowledge in future assignments was very beneficial.

# How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

- Creating a RestController, which served as the protected controller for my hash RESTful operations. In the future i would take the time to run a dependency check and assess what comes back and then take action from there.

# How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

- I ran the code multiple times over and changed small things to find what worked best. After refactoring, i run multiple dependency checks to make sure that no new vulnerabilities were found.

# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

- I took to StackOverflow and chatgpt to check my work and make sure that what I had completed was correct and did not have any errors.

# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

- From this assignment, i would show them that i was able to successfully implement check sum verification as well as successfully run a dependency check with minimal to no vulnerabilities present in the code i completed.
